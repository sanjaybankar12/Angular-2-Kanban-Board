Requirement :

 We use Angular 2 with typescript to developed this kanban board. This Kanban Board has 4 categories such as New , On-Hold, In-Progress and Done. In these 4 categories, We can add new TASK with 3 properties such as Name, Due Date, Priority. Data is hold in Typescript's Object.
 
 Task's can be sorted by 2 ways in Ascending Order:
  1)By Due Date
  2)By Priority
  
 After adding and sorting functionality, We can remove task from categories.
